## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Vite, Axios, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- AI Service: Google Gemini (GenAI)
- Auth: API key middleware

## My Contributions
- Set up the backend server architecture using Node.js and Express
- Implemented API routes that communicate with the Gemini API
- Configured API key authentication using middleware
- Managed environment variables and secure API access

## Key Learnings
- Integrating generative AI services into backend systems
- Designing secure API endpoints
- Separating concerns between frontend and backend responsibilities
